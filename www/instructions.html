	<h2>What is Blackout Poetry?</h2>
		<p>Blackout Poetry is like recycled poetry--taking something in its original form and re-imagining it into something new. Traditionally, blackout poetry involves paper with text, a black marker, and a mind open to possibilities. To make poetry, you would cross out any unwanted words with your marker, leaving only a few words visible that would come together to make a wonderful poem.</p>

	<h2>What to do?</h2>
        <p>01. After you hit the 'Let's Begin' button, you'll be taken to a page that prompts you to paste text. You can either go to your browser and copy text or write your own.</p>
        <p>02. Make sure to delete any line breaks. You'll want to avoid having paragraphs if you want the best result.</p>
        <p>03. Use the awesome tool bars to customize your text, and then draw over it!</p>
        <p>04. Save your poem by taking a screenshot! To do so on an iPad, press the <strong>Home</strong> button and your <strong>Power</strong> button, and then let go at the same time. After that, go to your photo library and it should be there.</p>
        <p>05. Start over!</p>
